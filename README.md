## üåê About Cloud Computing

Cloud computing enables users to access computing resources‚Äîsuch as servers, storage, and networking‚Äîon demand, without managing physical infrastructure. It offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency by following a pay-as-you-go model.

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a leading cloud provider, offering a wide range of scalable, secure, and reliable services. It supports Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), making it a powerful choice for businesses and individuals alike.
