# üå©Ô∏è AWS Projects: IAM & S3 Static Website Hosting

Welcome to my cloud computing project repository! This space showcases two foundational AWS hands-on projects that reflect my learning and practical experience with core AWS services: **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and **Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting**.

Cloud computing enables users to access computing resources‚Äîsuch as servers, storage, and networking‚Äîon demand, without the need for direct management. Instead of owning physical infrastructure, users can rent services on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a leading cloud provider offering a wide range of scalable, reliable, and cost-effective services. It supports various models such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), making it a preferred choice for many of my clients.

This repository includes real-world projects that I have personally implemented in production-like environments. These projects are part of my journey as a **Junior Cloud Engineer**, where I aim to deepen my understanding of AWS services through hands-on practice. I‚Äôve documented the architecture, setup steps, and configurations to serve as both a learning tool and a future reference.

# Included Projects
- **AWS IAM Configuration**  
  Manage users, groups, roles, and permissions securely using IAM best practices.

- **Static Website Hosting on Amazon S3**  
  Host and manage a static website using Amazon S3, including bucket policies and public access configurations.

These projects demonstrate my ability to work with core AWS services and follow cloud best practices. More projects will be added as I continue to grow in my cloud computing career.
